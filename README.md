Scrape HN to track links from specific domains

See [Scraping web pages from the command-line with shot-scraper](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Mar/14/scraping-web-pages-shot-scraper/) for details of how this works.

Recently scraped data from this repo is also published to this Datasette table:

More about how that works in [Datasetteâ€™s new JSON write API: The first alpha of Datasette 1.0](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Dec/2/datasette-write-api/).
